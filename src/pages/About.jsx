        Hello! I'm <strong>Shabeeb</strong>, a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on ReactJS. At just 22 years old, I've already gained 3 years of real-world experience building scalable and responsive web applications. My goal is to turn complex problems into simple, elegant solutions through clean and modular code.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'm proficient in <strong>ReactJS, JavaScript, JSX, HTML, and CSS</strong>, and I'm constantly pushing myself to stay current with the latest trends in front-end development. I’ve built everything from small UI components to full web applications, always aiming for a seamless user experience.
